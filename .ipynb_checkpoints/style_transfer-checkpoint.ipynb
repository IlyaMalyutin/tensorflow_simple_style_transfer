    "\n",
    "- the basic idea in 2015 by the german researchers was to repurpose a fully trained convolutional network to help trasnfer the style between two images.\n",
    "- we slice off the top layer since its used for classification and then \n",

    "\n",
    "This flowchart shows roughly the idea of the Style Transfer algorithm, although we use the VGG-16 model which has many more layers than shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two images are input to the neural network: A content-image and a style-image. We wish to generate the mixed-image which has the contours of the content-image and the colours and texture of the style-image.\n",
    "We do this by creating several loss-functions that can be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss-function for the content-image tries to minimize the difference between the features that are activated for the content-image and for the mixed-image, at one or more layers in the network. This causes the contours of the mixed-image to resemble those of the content-image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss-function for the style-image is slightly more complicated, because it instead tries to minimize the difference between the so-called Gram-matrices for the style-image and the mixed-image. This is done at one or more layers in the network. The Gram-matrix measures which features are activated simultaneously in a given layer. Changing the mixed-image so that it mimics the activation patterns of the style-image causes the colour and texture to be transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use TensorFlow to automatically derive the gradient for these loss-functions. The gradient is then used to update the mixed-image. This procedure is repeated a number of times until we are satisfied with the resulting image.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some details of the Style Transfer algorithm not shown in this flowchart, e.g. regarding calculation of the Gram-matrices, calculation and storage of intermediate values for efficiency, a loss-function for denoising the mixed-image, and normalization of the loss-functions so they are easier to scale relative to each other."
